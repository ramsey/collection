ramsey/collection is a PHP 5.6+ collections framework for representing and manipulating collections.

This project adheres to a [Contributor Code of Conduct][conduct]. By participating in this project and its community, you are expected to uphold this code.


## About

Much inspiration for this library came from the [Java Collections Framework][java].


## Installation

The preferred method of installation is via [Packagist][] and [Composer][]. Run
the following command to install the package and add it as a requirement to
your project's `composer.json`:

```bash
composer require ramsey/collection
```


## Examples

A collection represents a group of objects. Each object in the collection is of a specific, defined type.

### Generic Collection
This is a direct implementation of CollectionInterface, provided for the sake of convenience.
``` php
$collection = new \Ramsey\Collection\Collection('My\\Foo');
$collection->add(new \My\Foo());
$collection->add(new \My\Foo());

foreach ($collection as $foo) {
    // Do something with $foo
}
```

### Typed Collection
It is preferable to subclass AbstractCollection to create your own typed collections. For example:

``` php
namespace My\Foo;

class FooCollection extends \Ramsey\Collection\AbstractCollection
{
    public function getType()
    {
        return 'My\\Foo';
    }
}
```

And then use it similarly to the earlier example:

``` php
$fooCollection = new \My\Foo\FooCollection();
$fooCollection->add(new \My\Foo());
$fooCollection->add(new \My\Foo());

foreach ($fooCollection as $foo) {
    // Do something with $foo
}
```

One benefit of this approach is that you may do type-checking and type-hinting on the collection object.

``` php
if ($collection instanceof \My\Foo\FooCollection) {
    // the collection is a collection of My\Foo objects
}
```

#### Instantiating from an array of objects
In addition to `add`, you can also create a Typed Collection from an array of objects.

``` php
$foos = [
  new \My\Foo(),
  new \My\Foo()
];

$fooCollection = new \My\Foo\FooCollection($foos);
```
